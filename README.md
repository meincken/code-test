# Getting Started

install dependencies

`yarn install` or `npm run install`

To run this application

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

This will open the project in http://localhost:3000

Due to time constraints I didn't have time to write any test scripts, but had
planned it into my timeline.

// TODO

- [x] AC1: As a user running the application, I can view a list of recipe categories.
- [x] AC2: As a user running the application, selecting a meal category will show a list of recipes for that category.
- [x] AC3: As a user running the application, I can see a thumbnail for each item in the lists where available.
- [x] AC4: As a user running the application, I can see a detail page for each recipe when selecting one from a list.
- [ ] Unit test
- [ ] Add styles to each section
